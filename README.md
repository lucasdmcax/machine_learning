## Project Overview
Cars 4 You is an online car resale company that sells cars from multiple different
brands. Their business model involves an online platform in which users who
which to sell their cars to provide different sets of details about the car and
sending them to their chain of mechanics to get the car be evaluated before
purchasing it to, later, resell the car on a profit. Using this system, the managers
were able to gather an extensive list of happy customers. However, the
company’s growth has also led to increasing waiting lists for car inspection,
which is driving potential costumers to their competitors.
To address this, the company has reached out to you. Their main goal is to
expedite the evaluation process by creating a predictive model capable of
evaluating the price of a car based on the user’s input without needing the car to
be taken to a mechanic.

## Objectives
- Build and compare regression models for car price prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, R², etc.  
- Optimize the best-performing model through hyperparameter tuning 
- Deploy a scalable and user-friendly system for real-time predictions.
